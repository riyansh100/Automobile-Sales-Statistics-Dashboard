# Automobile-Sales-Statistics-Dashboard

Scenario:
The directors of XYZAutomobiles have requested a dashboard to be developed so they can drill into the data in more detail for specific years or by different categories. The task is to create a suitable dashboard and add in user interactions so that the directors can select the data they want to review without the need to request new plots.
The objective is to create dashboards to contain your plots and charts and to provide the directors with the ability to select a particular report or a period of time so they can discuss the data in detail.

The following tasks have been covered: 

1. Create a Dash application and give it a meaningful title. 

2. Add drop-downs to your dashboard with appropriate titles and options. 

3. Add a division for output display with appropriate 'id' and 'classname' property. 

4. Creating Callbacks; Define the callback function to update the input container.

5. Create and display graphs for Recession Report Statistics.

6. Create and display graphs for Yearly Report Statistics.
